EWA Splatting \cite{zwickerEWAVolumeSplatting2001} \cite{zwickerEWASplatting2002} 
is a high-quality splatting method based on Gaussian kernels.

The idea is based on Heckbert's EWA (Elliptical Weighted Average) filter for texture mapping.

\subparagraph{Gaussian Kernel}

Here we apply Multi-Variable Gaussian Kernel (\ref{eq:multi_variable_gaussian}) to the splatting equation.

\subparagraph{EWA Volome Resampling Filter}

The splatting equation (\ref{eq:splatting_equation}) represents the output image as a continuous 2D function, 
but in practice, it will be sampled at discrete pixel locations. So it has to be band-limited to respect to Nyquist frequency of the grid, to avoid aliasing.

By appling an appropriate low-pass filter $h(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$,we have 

$$(I_\lambda \otimes h)(\hat{\mathbf{x}})=
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}\sum\limits_{k }\limits^{} 
    c_{\lambda k}(\mu)g_kq_k(\mu)\prod\limits_{j=0}\limits^{k-1} 
    (1-g_jq_j(\mu))h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}-\mu)d\mu $$

we make two more assumptions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item the emission coefficient is approximately constant in supporting area $c_{\lambda x}$
    \item ignore the effect of shading 
    \item the attenuation factor is approximately constant 
\end{enumerate}

Thus we have 

$$\rho_k(\hat{\mathbf{x}})=(r_k \otimes h)(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$$

The resampling filter is strongly space-variant.

Swan et al. present uniform low-pass filter.

But our method provides non-uniform scaling in these cases.
