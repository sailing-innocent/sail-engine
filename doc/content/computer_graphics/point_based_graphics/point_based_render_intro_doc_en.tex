\input{point_based_render_brief_doc_en}

The most classic method for point-based rendering is splatting, which involves projecting points onto the screen and accumulating their color and opacity. This method is simple and efficient, but it has limitations in terms of anti-aliasing and filtering. To address these issues, researchers have proposed various improvements to the splatting method, such as EWA splatting, which uses elliptical weighted average filtering to improve the quality of the rendered image.
