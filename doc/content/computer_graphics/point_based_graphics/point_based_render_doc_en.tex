Point Cloud and Voxel are two primary techniques 
for representing data in 3D space. 
Volume-based methods fundamentally rely on back-mapping, 
which involves emitting rays from the camera towards the scene 
and accumulating color and opacity along the ray's path, 
a process exemplified by ray marching. 

Conversely, point-based methods utilize forward-mapping, 
akin to a rasterization process. 
This involves transforming points from world space to screen space, 
followed by 'splatting' onto the screen.
