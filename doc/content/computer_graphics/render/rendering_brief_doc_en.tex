Rendering is the heart of Computer Graphics. It seeks to emulate the process by which objects in the world are illuminated by light, the transportation of that light, and its eventual mapping onto a camera model to produce images. The input for this process is a detailed description of the scene, encompassing models of geometry, material, lighting, and camera parameters. The output is a high-resolution 2D RGB image.
