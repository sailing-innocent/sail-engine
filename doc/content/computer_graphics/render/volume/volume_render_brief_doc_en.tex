Traditional rendering methods are mostly based on triangular surface modeling, calculating the gloss, material, shadows, etc., of the object's surface and then projecting them onto the screen. However, in reality, many objects do not have a clear surface and cannot be modeled with simple triangular materials, such as clouds, jade, skin, etc. This forces us to extend simple 2D processing to 3D and to find methods for light transmission in space.
