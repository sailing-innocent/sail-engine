\begin{equation}
I_\lambda(\hat{\mathbf{x}})=
\int_0^L c_\lambda(\hat{\mathbf{x}}, \xi)
g(\hat{\mathbf{x}},\xi)
e^{-\int_0^\xi g(\hat{\mathbf{x}},\mu)d\mu}
d\xi
\label{eq:volume_render_equation}
\end{equation}

where $g(\mathbf{x})$ is the \textit{extinction function}
that defines the rate of light occlusion, 
and $c_\lambda(\mathbf{x})$ is an emission coefficient.

The exponential term is \textit{attenuation factor}, 
and the production of $c_\lambda(x)g(x)$ is also called source term, 
describing the light intensity scattered in the direction of light of ray 
$\hat{x}$ at point x.
