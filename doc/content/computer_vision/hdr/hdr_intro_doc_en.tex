Typical digital sensor can only capture light brightness 
in a limited range (e.g. 0-255 for each RGB channel).
However, in the real world, especially in natural scenes,
human eyes can perceive a much wider range of brightness.
Thus, HDR imaging and display techniques are developed to
overcome this limitation.
