Diffusion Model is a new popular model for AI Generate Content (AIGC) fields.

\paragraph{History}

previous work of using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics \cite{sohl-dicksteinDeepUnsupervisedLearning2015} 
to solve Deep Unsupervised Problem is the theoratical basis of Diffusion Model.

But this model didn't attract match attension until 2020, 
DDPM(\cite{hoDenoisingDiffusionProbabilistic2020}) started 
to use this kind of model to generate high-resolution images.

Then the high and stable version (\cite{rombachHighResolutionImageSynthesis2022})
, which uses Diffusion Model in Latent Space, 
finally makes this kind of method become the raising star
in AIGC spectrum.
