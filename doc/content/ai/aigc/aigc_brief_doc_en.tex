Unlike traditional AI keywords, 
the acronym AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) doesn't originate from academic terminology. 
Instead, it's a seamless evolution from the terms UGC (User Generated Content) and CGC (Creator Generated Content). 
These are widely-used business terms that describe the content creation process 
within social media platforms.

When we discuss AIGC, we're referring to content that AI algorithms 
generate based on various forms of input, such as text. 
This includes transformations like text-to-image, 
text-to-video, text-to-music, and image-to-video, among others

There are three main periods in the development of AIGC:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) Era
    \item Diffusion Model Era
\end{enumerate}
