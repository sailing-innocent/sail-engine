Because CUDA lacks a built-in swapchain buffering function, typically, 
the rendering implementation with CUDA is done through interoperation with existing graphics APIs, such as OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan.

But for this project, we only need to render image to a host buffer and write to a png file. So the first step is to find a way to export image.
