Similar to traditional 3D reconstruction tasks, novel view synthesis methods also need to establish their own mathematical models for scene representation (such as point clouds, meshes, implicit representations, etc.). However, 3D reconstruction is more concerned with the accuracy of spatial information, geometric information, surface texture features, and depth of the reconstructed scene. On the other hand, the new viewpoint generation task is more concerned with the accuracy of the visual effects of the scene. The novel view synthesis task task is a sub-problem in the 3D reconstruction field that focuses more on the quality of the generated image.
