Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the process of creating a fresh perspective of a scene 
using a collection of input images and their corresponding view transformations. 
Unlike traditional 3D reconstruction tasks, 
which prioritize geometric accuracy, 
NVS emphasizes the visual fidelity of the synthesized view.
