Since the introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), 
which set new standards in speed and quality for novel-view synthesis (NVS) tasks, 
it has garnered significant interest from the research community. 
Its unique approach of representing scenes as a Radiance Field combined with a mixture of 3D Gaussians 
has led to its widespread adoption in the realms of computer graphics and computer vision. 
This survey offers an in-depth review of 3DGS, 
encompassing its history, fundamental principles, workflow, and its diverse applications. 
Furthermore, we delve into the limitations of 3DGS and suggest potential avenues for future exploration and research.
