The Core Concepts of 3D Reconstruction

\paragraph{Images}

Images are the most common form of data in 
computer vision. They are represented as a 2D grid 
of pixels, where each pixel has a value 
representing the intensity of light at that point. 
The intensity can be represented in 
different color spaces, such as RGB, 
grayscale, or others. A typical RGB images of resolution $1024\times 768$
can be represented as a 3D tensor of shape $1024\times 768\times 3$, where 
each value entry is a scalar in the range of $[0.0, 1.0]$.

Images can be captured from various sources, 
such as cameras, satellites, or medical scanners.
When 3D reconstruction, multi-view images are typically 
our only sources of data to get start with. 
However, images themselves are lacking 3D information prior,
thus, we need to model our "camera" and "scene" to eliminate
the possible dimensions of space defined by the images.
