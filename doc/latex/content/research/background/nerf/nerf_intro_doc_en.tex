\paragraph{Neural Radiance Field}

By creating a differential volumetric renderer by substituding the radiance estimation process to Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP), Neural Radiance Field \cite{mildenhallNeRFRepresentingScenes2020}(NeRF) has become one of the most popular methods to solve the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) problem.

\paragraph{Development}

The Original NeRF method has a few shortcomings such as its slow speed on training and rendering.

\subparagraph{More Accurate}

The Mip NeRF 360 \cite{barronMipNeRF360Unbounded2022}
