  abstract = {We introduce Neural Flow Maps, a novel simulation method bridging the emerging paradigm of implicit neural representations with fluid simulation based on the theory of flow maps, to achieve state-of-the-art simulation of inviscid fluid phenomena. We devise a novel hybrid neural field representation, Spatially Sparse Neural Fields (SSNF), which fuses small neural networks with a pyramid of overlapping, multi-resolution, and spatially sparse grids, to compactly represent long-term spatiotemporal velocity fields at high accuracy. With this neural velocity buffer in hand, we compute long-term, bidirectional flow maps and their Jacobians in a mechanistically symmetric manner, to facilitate drastic accuracy improvement over existing solutions. These long-range, bidirectional flow maps enable high advection accuracy with low dissipation, which in turn facilitates high-fidelity incompressible flow simulations that manifest intricate vortical structures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our neural fluid simulation in a variety of challenging simulation scenarios, including leapfrogging vortices, colliding vortices, vortex reconnections, as well as vortex generation from moving obstacles and density differences. Our examples show increased performance over existing methods in terms of energy conservation, visual complexity, adherence to experimental observations, and preservation of detailed vortical structures.},

  abstract = {To date, large-scale fluid simulation with more details employing the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method or its variants is ubiquitous in computer graphics and digital entertainment applications. Higher accuracy and faster speed are two key criteria evaluating possible improvement of the underlying algorithms within any available framework. Such requirements give rise to high-fidelity simulation with more particles and higher particle density that will unavoidably increase computational cost significantly. In this paper, we develop a new general GPGPU acceleration framework for SPH-centric simulations founded upon a novel neighbor traversal algorithm. Our novel parallel framework integrates several advanced characteristics of GPGPU architecture (e.g., shared memory and register memory). Additionally, we have designed a reasonable task assignment strategy, which makes sure that all the threads from the same CTA belong to the same cell of the grid. With this organization, big bunches of continuous neighboring data can be loaded to the shared memory of a CTA and used by all its threads. Our method has thus low global-memory bandwidth consumption. We have integrated our method into both WCSPH and PCISPH, that are two improved variants in recent years, and demonstrated its performance with several scenarios involving multiple-fluid interaction, dam break, and elastic solid. Through comprehensive tests validated in practice, our work can exhibit up to 2.18x speedup when compared with other state-of-the-art parallel frameworks.},

  abstract = {Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.},

  abstract = {In fluid simulation, enforcing incompressibility is crucial for realism; it is also computationally expensive. Recent work has improved efficiency, but still requires time-steps that are impractical for real-time applications. In this work we present an iterative density solver integrated into the Position Based Dynamics framework (PBD). By formulating and solving a set of positional constraints that enforce constant density, our method allows similar incompressibility and convergence to modern smoothed particle hydro-dynamic (SPH) solvers, but inherits the stability of the geometric, position based dynamics method, allowing large time steps suitable for real-time applications. We incorporate an artificial pressure term that improves particle distribution, creates surface tension, and lowers the neighborhood requirements of traditional SPH. Finally, we address the issue of energy loss by applying vorticity confinement as a velocity post process.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

  abstract = {Snow is a challenging natural phenomenon to visually simulate. While the graphics community has previously considered accumulation and rendering of snow, animation of snow dynamics has not been fully addressed. Additionally, existing techniques for solids and fluids have difficulty producing convincing snow results. Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this paper presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character interactions.},
