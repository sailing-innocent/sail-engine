We propose HDR-GS, a novel differential rendering framework 
that recover a High Dynamic Range (HDR) radiance fields through
3D Gaussians with only Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images.
We extends the original Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer Camera 
with tone-mapping module to model the real-world digital in-camera 
imaging pipeline (ISP). Our experiments show that HDR-GS 
can achieve state-of-the-art performance and quality rendering 
high-dynamic range images from a LDR images.
